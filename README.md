# Applied AI + Backend Systems Engineering Roadmap

### Note: Go to the readme branch to access it's contents
This repository documents my structured journey toward becoming an Applied AI / LLM Systems Engineer. It contains all study notes, architectural principles, design rules, experiments, and implementation artifacts across every phase of the roadmap, from systems mindset and probabilistic reasoning to production-grade AI services with observability, evaluation, and deployment discipline.

The focus is system-first engineering, not trend-driven experimentation. Every concept is tied to concrete implementation, failure modes, cost considerations, and production reliability.

The repository covers:

Phase 0: Systems mindset, AI design rules, deterministic vs probabilistic thinking
[Phase 0.md](./Phase%200.md)

Phase 1–2: RAG engineering, structured LLM usage, failure-aware AI systems

Phase 3: Strongly-typed backend systems (.NET Core)

Phase 4: Model engineering, ONNX interoperability

Phase 5: DevOps, reliability, observability

Phase 6: LLM evaluation, gold datasets, regression pipelines

All learning is documented through markdown notes, architectural breakdowns, and implementation-backed experiments.

Goal: Build AI systems that are controllable, observable, cost-aware, and production-ready.
